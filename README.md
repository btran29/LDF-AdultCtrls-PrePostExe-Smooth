Laser Doppler Flowmetry batch processing script. Takes in time, pressure, temp, and perfusion data from a laser doppler flowmeter and organizes it into a neat little workbook. The batch script will hopefully save you some time. 

More info in 'LDF_batch.m'.

Also, as it was my first foray into programming, it is poorly written for your convenience. I will attempt to make it better someday.
